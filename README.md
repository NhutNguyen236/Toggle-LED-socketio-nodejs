# Toggling LED using ESP8266 and Socket.io 
- Generally, the project is toggling the LED on the ESP8266 using the socket server.
- In details, I've turned ESP8266 into a socket client using SocketIOClient_Generic, meanwhile Nodejs plays as a Socket server using Socket.io.
- You can change the code in client side to do more jobs.

## Warning
- There is a library called SocketIOClient, which origianlly made by Markus Sattler, you can find it [here](https://github.com/khoih-prog/WebSockets_Generic) but the its Readme said that the library is deprecated.
